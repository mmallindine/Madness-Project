# About 

The majority of sources I have consulted have come from the Digital Transgender Archive, which has entirely digitized collections including books, newspapers, magazines, pictures, and more. In searching for evidence for this paper, my goal was to find anything related to psycahitry in the archive from 1950 to 1970. Here is a brief rundown of my sources, and more will be explained in the article. 

Arnold Wells, "Exlcusive! MD Reveals the Fourth Sex!" This is a newspaper article in *The National Insider* from 1964. Wells documents transsexuals and details a bit about their life and the specifics of medically altering sex.

Edward Podolsky and Carlson Wade, *Transvestism Today*. A short book published in 1960 specifically for psychaitrists, psychologists, and the like. The authors write about transvestism and transsexualism in history, in other cultures, and how transsexuality should be understood by professionals. 

Bruno Bettelheim, *Love is Not Enough*. In this book, Bettelheim documents psychaitric treatment of children in a psychiatric instituion. Bettelheim covers all aspects of their treatment including their daily schedules, schooling, recreation, and hygiene routines. 

Rainer, John D. and Kenneth Z. Altahuler, eds. *Psychiatry and the Deaf*. This is a report of the U.S. Department of Health, Eduaction, and Welfare. The editors document several cases of psychiatry specific to teh deaf community. In the section I use for this project, Dr. Syed Abdullah describes one of his patients. 

Hugo G. Beigel, "The Myth of Latent Femininity in the Male." This magazine article was written by Dr. Beigel, a psychologist, and he argues that there is no reason transsexuality should be affirmed, as he thinks transsexuality is simply an illness.

Gary Alinder, "Psychiatry: Crime Against Nature." Alinder wrote this newspaper article, in a left-wing newspaper, as reporting on the Gay Liberation Front's infiltration of the National Convention of the American Psychiatric Association.
