In September 1951, an American Army veteran named George Jorgensen began to receive a series of surgical operations to change his sex. By the end of 1952, Jorgensen had completed surgical sex reassignment and now had a passport reflecting her new name, Christine. Jorgensen was the first largely publicized case of sex change for an American citizen. The large press coverage of her transition gave more public attention to transsexualism, but did not create any conclusions. American psychiatrists were unsure of the cause of transsexualism or how to treat it. The general debate was to affirm and medically alter the transsexual’s body, as was the case with Christine Jorgensen, or to encourage the transsexual to embrace more masculine behaviors, as was the case with countless other psychiatric patients expressing transsexuality.[^note1]

With the political climate opening more dialogue to resisting transgender affirmation and acceptance, it is important to understand the origins of this debate. The recent spotlight of transgender issues in politics has reignited a debate about the ability to, and limits of, changing an individual’s sex. Many of the arguments heard today mirror that of the 1950s and 1960s, when transsexuality came into American discourse.

## Transsexual Affirmation

A 1964 article of The National Insider by Arnold Wells titled “Exclusive! MD Reveals the Fourth Sex!: Not Female, Not Male, and Not Homosexual,” provides a sensationalist account of the emergence of transsexualism in public discourse. The “fourth sex” that Wells documents is the transsexual, specifically men who wish to become or have become women. Although this was written over a decade after Christine Jorgensen’s case rose to fame, Wells’s article articulates how society understood transsexuals. He reports: “members of the medical profession are divided in better controversy about it,” “Religious groups are ready to condemn it,” and “laws of every state are a mass confusion.” Despite the divide in the medical profession and societal confusion/distain for accepting these individuals, Wells writes about several psychiatrists that believe the only cure to transexual desires is to affirm both socially and surgically.  

In the article, Wells includes pictures of several of these transexuals in revealing outfits that show feminine body characteristics, including a nude photo of Coccinelle, a French transsexual and performer. Her body was positioned to not show anything too revealing for a newspaper, but the obvious sexual suggestiveness of the photo comes from her clearly feminine physique, facial expression, and hairstyle. The photograph mimics the pin-up girl art made famous in WWII and the images that would be used in Playboy, the popular magazine for the male sexual appetite. Intimate Matters, 280, 302-303.  

By framing transsexual women in the eyes of the male gaze, not to mention referring to transsexuals as women and using she/her pronouns to describe them, Wells creates a strongly affirming narrative of transsexuals as females. Beyond how Wells frames the women, the psychiatrists he quotes and cites also leave no room for misinterpretation. Summing up the findings of Dr. Pauly and Dr. Benjamin, their understanding of the transsexual is simply: “As women, they hate the male organs attached to their bodies.” The article also says that psychiatry had been unable to “cure” any transsexuals, that is, to get the transsexual to wish to live as a man, and the only fix to the mind-body disruption is for surgical operation.  

*Transvestism Today*, a book written for psychiatrists in 1960 by Edward Podolsky, a sexologist, and Carlson Wade, a self-described “pulp sexologist,” argue to psychiatrists the need to understand the differences between men who want to medically alter their sex (transsexuals) and men who dress as women for entertainment purposes (transvestites). They argue that understanding the difference is important to not only how the transsexuals/transvestites are treated by the medical community, but also in determining the cause of the conditions.  

One of the issues that the authors of *Transvestism Today* tackle is whether or not someone who is physically healthy should have surgical intervention. With these medical ethics, it would be impossible to perform a sex-change operation, as there is nothing that is physically cured with this operation that a physician could prove, as transsexualism is a condition of the mind. This sparks room for the debate of the origin of transsexuality. If it is a choice, and the transsexual is only having a mental urge to become the opposite sex, then medical intervention is unnecessary and it should be left to psychiatrists. However, if a cause can be determined that shows medical intervention is necessary for someone who is “mentally ‘female’” but physically male, as the authors of *Transvestism Today* put it, then a sex-change operation would be medically necessary. (Transvestism Today, “What is Trans-Sexualism?”) 

This is the reason the separation of transsexualism and transvestism was so important to Podolsky and Wade, who quote and cite the same doctor that Wells used in his newspaper article, Dr. Benjamin. Dr. Benjamin stated, “most transvestites would be horrified at the idea of being operated on” to change their sex, while transsexuals “only live for the day when his hated sex organs can be removed, organs which to him are a dreadful deformity.” Dr. Benjamin framing transsexualism as a deformity, rather than a mental condition, shows that medically necessary treatment is required to fix a female person, born into a male body.  

The book ends with a short section quoting Dr. Samuel B. Kutash, a psychologist who worked in the New York State Department of Correction. He wrote a critique of how laws regarding dressing norms effect male transvestites and transsexuals (meaning anyone assigned male at birth who dresses as female with without permanent sex change in mind) much more than a female wearing male clothing. He noted that the law, as written, did not differ from a male or female wearing the others clothing, but in application the law was used against male transvestites and transsexuals. (Transvestism Today, “The Law Looks at Transvestism”) 

Dr. Kenneth Walker, also quoted in *Transvestism Today*, supplements Kutash’s statement about unequal policing of gender norms in the same chapter. Walker stated that the law steps in to barr males from dressing as females, so when a medical operation can make the transsexual compliant with the law, the psychiatric and otherwise medical community finds ways to show that the transsexual is in some way mentally ill, not a female. He offered the following quotes regarding societal unacceptance of allowing transsexuals to live as they please: 

  “Instead of treating the patients themselves, we might treat with more profit the society which makes it so difficult for these unfortunate people live.”
  
  “In time – and many years will be required for this – a society which at present looks upon these strange afflictions of their fellow men with loathing, hated, and horror may become sufficiently educated to look upon them with compassion. Or is this too much to expect of nations which claim to follow the teachings of God?”
