In September 1951, an American Army veteran named George Jorgensen began to receive a series of surgical operations to change his sex. By the end of 1952, Jorgensen had completed surgical sex reassignment and now had a passport reflecting her new name, Christine. Jorgensen was the first largely publicized case of sex change for an American citizen. The large press coverage of her transition gave more public attention to transsexualism, but did not create any conclusions. American psychiatrists were unsure of the cause of transsexualism or how to treat it. The general debate was to affirm and medically alter the transsexual’s body, as was the case with Christine Jorgensen, or to encourage the transsexual to embrace more masculine behaviors, as was the case with countless other psychiatric patients expressing transsexuality.[1]

With the political climate opening more dialogue to resisting transgender affirmation and acceptance, it is important to understand the origins of this debate. The recent spotlight of transgender issues in politics has reignited a debate about the ability to, and limits of, changing an individual’s sex. Many of the arguments heard today mirror that of the 1950s and 1960s, when transsexuality came into American discourse.  


## Transsexual Affirmation

A 1964 article of *The National Insider* by Arnold Wells titled “Exclusive! MD Reveals the Fourth Sex!: Not Male, Not Female, and Not Homosexual,” provides a sensationalist account of the emergence of transsexualism in public discourse. The “fourth sex” that Wells documents is the transsexual, specifically men who wish to become or have become women. Although this was written over a decade after Christine Jorgensen’s case rose to fame, Wells’s article articulates how society understood transsexuals. He reports: “members of the medical profession are divided in better controversy about it,” “Religious groups are ready to condemn it,” and “laws of every state are a mass confusion.” Despite the divide in the medical profession and societal confusion/distain for accepting these individuals, Wells writes about several psychiatrists that believe the only cure to transexual desires is to affirm both socially and surgically.[2]

In the article, Wells includes pictures of several of these transexuals in revealing outfits that show feminine body characteristics, including a nude photo of Coccinelle, a French transsexual and performer. Her body was positioned to not show anything too revealing for a newspaper, but the obvious sexual suggestiveness of the photo comes from her clearly feminine physique, facial expression, and hairstyle. The photograph mimics the pin-up girl art made famous in WWII and the images that would be used in Playboy, the popular magazine for the male sexual appetite.[3]

By framing transsexual women in the eyes of the male gaze, not to mention referring to transsexuals as women and using she/her pronouns to describe them, Wells creates a strongly affirming narrative of transsexuals as females. Beyond how Wells frames the women, the psychiatrists he quotes and cites also leave no room for misinterpretation. Summing up the findings of Dr. Pauly and Dr. Benjamin, their understanding of the transsexual is simply: “As women, they hate the male organs attached to their bodies.” The article also says that psychiatry had been unable to “cure” any transsexuals, that is, to get the transsexual to wish to live as a man, and the only fix to the mind-body disruption is for surgical operation.  

*Transvestism Today*, a book written for psychiatrists in 1960 by Edward Podolsky, a sexologist, and Carlson Wade, a self-described “pulp sexologist,” argue to psychiatrists the need to understand the differences between men who want to medically alter their sex (transsexuals) and men who dress as women for entertainment purposes (transvestites). They argue that understanding the difference is important to not only how the transsexuals/transvestites are treated by the medical community, but also in determining the cause of the conditions.  

One of the issues that the authors of *Transvestism Today* tackle is whether or not someone who is physically healthy should have surgical intervention. With these medical ethics, it would be impossible to perform a sex-change operation, as there is nothing that is physically cured with this operation that a physician could prove, as transsexualism is a condition of the mind. This sparks room for the debate of the origin of transsexuality. If it is a choice, and the transsexual is only having a mental urge to become the opposite sex, then medical intervention is unnecessary and it should be left to psychiatrists. However, if a cause can be determined that shows medical intervention is necessary for someone who is “mentally ‘female’” but physically male, as the authors of *Transvestism Today* put it, then a sex-change operation would be medically necessary.[4]

This is the reason the separation of transsexualism and transvestism was so important to Podolsky and Wade, who quote and cite the same doctor that Wells used in his newspaper article, Dr. Benjamin. Dr. Benjamin stated, “most transvestites would be horrified at the idea of being operated on” to change their sex, while transsexuals “only live for the day when his hated sex organs can be removed, organs which to him are a dreadful deformity.” Dr. Benjamin framing transsexualism as a deformity, rather than a mental condition, shows that medically necessary treatment is required to fix a female person, born into a male body.  

The book ends with a short section quoting Dr. Samuel B. Kutash, a psychologist who worked in the New York State Department of Correction. He wrote a critique of how laws regarding dressing norms effect male transvestites and transsexuals (meaning anyone assigned male at birth who dresses as female with without permanent sex change in mind) much more than a female wearing male clothing. He noted that the law, as written, did not differ from a male or female wearing the others clothing, but in application the law was used against male transvestites and transsexuals.[5]

Dr. Kenneth Walker, also quoted in *Transvestism Today*, supplements Kutash’s statement about unequal policing of gender norms in the same chapter. Walker stated that the law steps in to barr males from dressing as females, so when a medical operation can make the transsexual compliant with the law, the psychiatric and otherwise medical community finds ways to show that the transsexual is in some way mentally ill, not a female. He offered the following quotes regarding societal unacceptance of allowing transsexuals to live as they please: 

  “Instead of treating the patients themselves, we might treat with more profit the society which makes it so difficult for these unfortunate people live.”
  
  “In time – and many years will be required for this – a society which at present looks upon these strange afflictions of their fellow men with loathing, hated, and horror may become sufficiently educated to look upon them with compassion. Or is this too much to expect of nations which claim to follow the teachings of God?”

The role of the psychiatrist in treating the transsexual was essentially to ensure the transsexual was truly female in mind, just not in body. Podolsky and Wade, as well as Wells, have sections of their work that state therapy is needed to ensure the transsexual is of a sound mind, which would eliminate the possibility that the transsexual was a mentally sick man, but instead a woman who needed medical treatment. Since authors of both works recognize that psychiatry had been unable to fix transsexual desires, they were clear in their conclusion that the best course of action for transsexuals was affirmation of their identities and medical procedures to align their body and mind. 


## Gender Roles in Psychiatric Treatment

In postwar America, there was a significant shift in the way Americans thought about sex. Specific to how children were taught about sex, before the war sex education was a private matter. It was up to parents to talk to their children about sex, and often it was kept vague and was not comprehensive enough for children to understand exactly what was being discussed. By the 1950s, sex education had changed and Americans realized the need for children to know about their bodies (at an age appropriate level) to be able to express themselves and understand what healthy sexual habits were. The idea here was that through more in-depth education, children would be less likely to unhealthy experiment with sex and their bodies, leading to a sexually healthier society.[6]

Just as this shift in attitudes towards sex education were happening, Bruno Bettelheim published Love is Not Enough, a book documenting life in an unnamed children’s psychiatric institution. Bettelheim documents several male children in the book who claimed to be female or want to be female, and subsequently documents how the psychiatric staff responded to and corrected this behavior. The children’s desires stemmed anywhere from wanting to grow their hair out long and wear girls clothes, to some even expressing that they wanted to remove their genitals. The psychiatric staff had several responses to these children, all of which involved reasserting gender norms.[7] 

As part of the general psychiatric treatment at the children’s institution, the children were allowed to select their own clothing. The psychiatrists believed that this gave the children a sense of control over their lives, allowing them not to feel trapped in the institution. This also allowed the children to express themselves, including their inner thoughts and fears. One child, whom Bettelheim refers to as Chris (all of the children in the book are given pseudonyms), had a “schizophrenic-like” personality and only wore clothes with holes in them. The staff at the institution eventually came to believe, and Chris admitted, he feared being shot at or impaled, so he wore clothes with holes in them to let himself know that he was still alive, but having clothes with no holes meant that his shooting or impalement was still coming. Since this helped Chris express himself, he was allowed to wear clothes with holes.  

Another child, George, would go outside in a hot summer day in thick socks, boots, and a heavy jacket. On cold winter days he would go outside in sandals, without socks, and in a shorts and a T-shirt. Bettelheim states “no efforts are made to argue the unreasonableness” of these actions, as the psychiatric staff understand it is part of the child’s mental state to want to do such things, therefor he can do it. Since clothing is symbolic, Bettelheim claims, allowing children to express themselves with the small amount of freedom they have is important to understanding them and helping them integrate into society.  

 

The same luxury was not given to male children who wished to present as female. There were limits as to the kinds of expression that were allowed and the kids that were not. One of the institutions rules, whether this was official or unofficial is unclear, is, “even with the freedom we permit, the child must still conform in some measure to the conventions of the world,” further, “we do not let a boy select girls’ dresses (or vice versa) no matter how strong his transvestite tendencies may be.” The line of acceptable and unacceptable social norms was firmly rooted in gender expression. Believing oneself to be impaled or shot was within the conventions of the world, as was risking heat stroke or hypothermia, but gender deviance is where the line was drawn for the psychiatrists and staff in this institution.  

One child, Lester, was clever enough to work around the clothing restrictions. He grew out his hair long and refused to allow anyone to cut it, citing that he wanted to look like a girl. Lester, and others who disobeyed the dress and appearance standard, was not allowed to go out beyond the immediate vicinity of the institution under their supervision, as doing so would “make a fool of himself in society.” Since Lester’s hair did not abide by the gendered expectations of the time, the institution leadership claimed that they had an “obligation to protect him from ridicule.” Lester did later open up to his counselor, mentioning that beyond looking like a girl, he wanted to become a girl. He explained to his counselor how he wanted his genitals gone, which the counselor dismissed as a “fear of castration.”  

In another section of Bettelheim’s book, discussing bathing habits, a child called Louis expressed that he wished to be a girl. His confession came after counselors at the institution noticed that he would try to hide his genitals between his legs. During conversation with his counselor, Louis revealed his wish to be a girl, and that during free time he would play make-believe games as a female character. Further, he stated that he viewed himself as a girl. The specific course of his treatment is unclear in Bettelheim's narrative, as is the case with Lester. It is noted that Louis made “considerable progress,” but the specifics of his treatment are unknown.[8]
