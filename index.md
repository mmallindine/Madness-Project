Unlike commercial platforms such as Wix or Squarespace, Xanthan emphasizes openness and durability over quick customization. Updating your site takes a little more attention to detail, but you don’t need any technical background to get started. 

The goal is to provide a gentle path into digital publishing that foregrounds technical literacy, collaboration, sustainability, design and storytelling as essential tools for communicating about the humanities.
