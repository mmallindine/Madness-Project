In the 1950s and 1960s, transvestism and transsexualism were the subject of debate in psychiatric circles in terms of treatments and causes. Some psychiatrists beleived the condition could be cured, while others thought the best course of action was affirmation of the transsexuals desires. 

At its core, this is a debate of whether psychiatry was as service to societal norms or a service to the patients requesting treatment. 

Using the navigation bar above, you will find different sections wherein I argue that psychiatric knowledge about transsexuality was inconcistent among pstchaitrists and further that although some psychiatrists thought affirming transsexuality would be benefitial for patients, the greater crisis of masculinity would lead psychiatrists to attempt to cure transsexual desires among male-to-female transsexuals.  

A note on terminology: the term "transgender" as used in contemporary society is not an accurate reflection of the accounts of psychiatrtists in the 1950s and 1960s. In order to preserve historical terminology while also being respectful to the patients who had this lived experience, I use the term "transexual" to refer to patients seeking medical intervention to change their sex. When the term "transvestite" appears, unless otherwise noted, it is used to refer to men who dress as women but have no desire to change their sex. The use of pronouns to describe patients will be consistant with what the psychiatrists wrote, which may at times seem inconsistant with the gender expression of the patient.
