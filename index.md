# Causes and Treatments of Transsexuality in America, 1950-1969


In the 1950s and 1960s, transsexualism was the subject of debate in psychiatric circles in terms of treatments and causes. Some psychiatrists beleived the condition could be cured, while others thought the best course of action was affirmation of the transsexuals desires. 

Using the navigation bar above, you will find bief synposes of my sources, the research article, and my full bibliography. 

A note on terminology: the term "transgender" as used in contemporary society is not an accurate reflection of the accounts of psychiatrtists in the 1950s and 1960s. I use the term "transexual" to refer to patients seeking medical intervention to change their sex. The term "transvestite" is used to refer to men who dress as women but have no desire to change their sex. At times, "transvestite" will appear in quotes where the person being quoted uses the term differently from me, and I have tried to make that clear when used. The use of pronouns to describe people will be consistant with what the sources have, which may at times seem inconsistant with the gender expression of the patient. The intent of this research is not to determine a person's gender identity, but to show the ways gender norms were used in psychiatric treatment.
