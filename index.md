In the 1950s and 1960s, transvestism and transsexualism were the subject of debate in psychiatric circles in terms of treatments and causes. Some psychiatrists beleived the condition could be cured, while others thought the best course of action was affirmation of the transsexuals desires. 

At its core, this is a debate of whether psychiatry was as service to societal norms or a service to the patients requesting treatment. 

Using the navigation bar above, you will find different sections wherein I argue that psychiatric knowledge about transsexuality was inconcistent among pstchaitrists and further that although some psychiatrists thought affirming transsexuality would be benefitial for patients, the greater crisis of masculinity would lead psychiatrists to attempt to cure transsexual desires among male-to-female transsexuals.  

A note on terminology: the term "transgender" as used in contemporary society is not an accurate reflection of the accounts of psychiatrtists in the 1950s and 1960s. I use the term "transexual" to refer to patients seeking medical intervention to change their sex. The term "transvestite is used to refer to men who dress as women but have no desire to change their sex. At times, "transvestite" will appear in quotes where the person being quoted uses the term differently from me, and I have tried to make that clear when used. The use of pronouns to describe people will be consistant with what the sources have, which may at times seem inconsistant with the gender expression of the patient. The intent of this research is not to determine a person's gender identity, but to show the ways gender norms were used in psychiatric treatment.
